# Splitastic

Splitastic is an open source self hosted chores/expenses splitting app.

Mobile phones are first class citizens in this app. This means you should use this app on a mobile phone for the best experience.

See it in action here: https://splitastic.epicnerf.com/

## Why another chores/expenses splitting app you ask?
There is no free (no ads), open source or self hosted alternative to all those apps out there.
Splitastic is here to change that!

## Getting Started
The project consists of 2 parts:
* Java Spring server which connects to a MySQL database (needs to be MySQL because of raw queries). See server readme for more information.
* TypeScript Vue PWA client. See client readme for more information.
